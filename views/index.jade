            p.
              I'm 27-year old software developer who is currently studying his 4th year in Metropolia in Helsinki, Finland, whose
               life goal is to always improve himself. 
              Programming and techonology interest me, along with Japanese animation, reading, having debates over seemingly silly things, and games.

            h3 MetCat 2.0

            .description
              p.
                In this project my team's goal was to customize an existing template provided by Finna for the ends of Metropolia UAS's
                 library. The project was fairly straight forward as most of the code base already existed and we had fairly good relations
                 with the library representative. Probably the most difficult about the project was finding our way through the maze that is
                 known as Smarty, and not being able to use convenient tools such as IDE or a version control system. The project was a really
                 good chance for me to refresh my CSS and PHP knowledge, and to learn about challenges related to setting up a trivial database
                 for production.

                An Android-app which fetches reservation and realization data from Metropolia API and saves it locally to SQLite database. 
                User can afterwards view the saved data offline and use it to make their own schedule. Currently work is still in progress,
                 and the user can only save and view the data.

            h3 BMI-calculator

            .description
              p.
                A small school project where the aim was to create a BMI-calculator using Google Web-Toolkit.
                 The project was fairly simple to get working from the basic Hello World -template generated by Eclipse and
                 probably the only challenging bit was figuring what goes where. <Note to self: kirjoita lisää>

            h3 Chat-room application

            .description
              p.
                School project where the aim was to develop a chat room application that was to be deployed on Google App Engine.
                 The platform and inexperience gave some restrictions to development, and instead of using more mainstream application frameworks such
                 as Flask, Tornado, Django, I ended using pure webapp2. For templates I used Jinja2.
                 #[a(href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/introduction") Both webapp2 and Jinja2 are endorsed by Google.]

              p.
                The project was really challenging at the time, since I had to learn how to make AJAX-calls along with having to deal with
                 webpage design, even if I gained some help to design from Bootstrap CSS-library, which was introduced to me at the time. 
                 The web application involved handling database in form of storing the chat messages to Google App Engine's servers, which was thankfully
                 rather easy thanks to the NDB ORM library provided natively by webapp2.

              p.
                Having mostly written Java before the project, getting to use script-language such as Python was a really fresh breeze and
                 really left into me a strong impression. I have had interest towards functional languages ever since the project, and led me
                 to such madness as embedding Scala-code to a separate, previously purely Java, Android project. Though I don't think I will
                 return to coding webapp2 again, this project will always carry on within me.
